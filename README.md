-Hi, I’m @0Akin0
-I’m interested in programming(obviously), specifically how to code well and low level languages. I like lerning low level languages to understand how the computer works on a low level, general projects I do in high level languages like C#. I like to work on whatever I find interesting.
-I’m currently learning C, test driven development, software architecture, design patterns, refactoring. Not all at once, but that is my list so far.
